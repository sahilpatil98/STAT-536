# Master's Project: Exploration rate and RL

The code for my Master's Thesis exploring the early effects of using Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm as pricing strategies in a duopoly market setting. This tries to uncover the effect of changing exploration rates on ending price decisions of competitors and tries to identify a function that can map the changing behavior.
